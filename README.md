## Project Overview
The purpose of this analyses is to understand how common markers like blood pressure, serum cholesterol, heart rate, etc., contribute to the presence of cardiovascular diseases. I also drew some correlations between patients' age, heart rate, the presence of chest pain and heart disease.

## Tools Used
To complete the study, the following data analytics tools were utilized:
1. Excel - For data import and cleaning
2. SQL - For more cleaning and analysis
3. Power BI - For visualization

## Methods and Questions
Before analyzing the dataset, I checked for duplicates, nulls, and missing values. To a large extent, the raw data was clean and ready for querying. After getting the summary statistics, I answered the following questions during the exploratory data analysis:
1. What age brackets are covered in the analysis?
2. How many men and women made up the total count? (0 for , 1 for   )
3. How were chest pain types distributed among the participants? (0, 1, 2, 3)
4. What was the average resting blood pressure?
5. What is the correlation between chestpain and heartrate?
6. How is serum cholesterol distributed amongst patients?
7. What percentage of the patients had high fasting sugar levels?
8. What is the grouping of resting electrocardiogram among patients? (0 for, 1 for, 2 for)
9. What is the distribution of maximum heart rate by age?
10. How many patients have exercise-induced angina?
11. What is the percentage of patients with heart disease?
12. What is the average old peak among patients?
13. What are the metrics for the oldest patient?
14. What are the metrics for the patient with the lowest blood pressure?
15. How many patients have defects in all of their blood vessels?
16. How is the presence of a heart disease linked to gender and heart rate?
